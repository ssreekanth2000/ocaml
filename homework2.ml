Remarks, if any: The functions you have given and the regex things have
been trouble when I try to implement them.

(*
 *
 * Please fill in this file with your solutions and submit it
 *
 * The functions below are stubs that you should replace with your
 * own implementation.
 *
 * PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE TYPES IN THE STUBS BELOW.
 * Doing so risks making it impossible for me to test your code.
 *
 * Always make sure you can #use this file in a FRESH OCaml shell
 * before submitting it. It has to load without any errors.

(* This function is the base function that basically loops through all
 * strings of length up to n, and prints those that are in the
 * language of the regular expression
 *
 * This is being way too clever to try to not blow the stack
 * while enumerating all strings up to a given length. Basically.
 * we enumerate all integer, convert them to base K (where K is the
 * size of the alphabet) and then replace every digit base K by the
 * letter of the alphabet at the corresponding index in the alphabet.
 *
 * The key is that we can enumerate integers super easily
